            <h4>Purpose of this Study</h4>
            <p>The purpose of the study is to investigate the basic human mechanisms of cue learning and utility-based decision making. This project is funded by the Army Research Laboratory, ARL-CRA-Cylab-Pennsylvania State University.</p>

            <h4>Procedures  </h4>
            <p>You will be asked to utilize a computer tool that simulates abstract and realistic cyber attacks. You will act in the role of a security analyst, observe network events, and determine if there is an attack on the cyber infrastructure. You will later be asked to respond to a survey. You may also watch a short video or read a short commentary and be asked to respond afterwards.
                <br>
                The duration and location of the study will be consistent with the advertisement for your session.  </p>
